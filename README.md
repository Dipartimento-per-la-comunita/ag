# Design Jekyll Theme

A Jekyll theme based on the [UI Kit](https://github.com/italia/design-ui-kit) and built with [Bootstrap Italia](https://github.com/italia/bootstrap-italia/).

## Getting started

The theme itself is a starting point for a Jekyll-based website. You can refer to the [official Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) for further details on how to install it locally.

If you already have `bundler` installed, you can install jekyll and budler gems with:

`bundle install`

Then, build the site and make it available on a local server with:

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

The website will be available on http://localhost:4000.
